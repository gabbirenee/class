        <h2>History of "Hink"</h2>
        <p>Over the years, Butler University students-and even staffers on occasion- have served as the costumed bulldog mascot. Originally known as the "Butler Bulldog," and now "Hink," University records indicate that the first Bulldog mascot costume appeared at a football game in 1922 and was worn by a female student.</p>
        <p>The look of the bulldog costume evolved naturally, and today's Hink costume is derived from a head and suit designed and manufactured by the Walt Disney Co. more than 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>The current Hink costume was acquired in 2009 after the previous version was stolen and vandalized in the summer of that year after nearly a decade of use. The case of the missing mascot costume case garnered much media and public attention which not only assisted in justice being served, but also initiated a contest to name Butler's costumed Bulldog.</p>
        <p>The name "Hink" was chosen in honor of Butler legend and former athletic director, basketball, football, and baseball coach Paul D. "Tony" Hinkle.</p>
